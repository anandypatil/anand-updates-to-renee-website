              <div>
                I was born on a military base in Key West. As a military kid, I got 
                a lot of opportunities to travel and see different walks of life around 
                the country. It also came with its tribulations though, as I had to learn 
                how to leave friends and family and pick up in a completely new environment. 
                Packing all my belongings, going house hunting, and learning how to say goodbyes 
                became a normal part of my life and taught me 
                how to be adaptable and friendly with everyone. I grew up in obscure suburbs 
                outside the cities of Boston, D.C., Minneapolis, and Cincinnati, and I have met 
                a range of different people and picked up different hobbies and interests along
                 the way. Although difficult at times, I will be grateful for the 
                 experiences and opportunities that military life gave me, as it has shaped 
                 me into who I am.

                In elementary school, I was introduced to Scratch, where I learned 
                block coding. I feel lucky to have gone to a primary school that was really 
                focused on engineering. From programming a little orange cat in Scratch to 
                building the highest tower out of spaghetti and marshmallows, I knew I had a 
                passion for STEM from a young age. This passion grew with me as I learned in 
                high school that despite the opportunities this country has given me, there are 
                injustices being upheld in the United States. I quickly realized 
                that if I wanted to see change happen, I had to make it happen myself because 
                no one else would fight for me. Leaving high school, I knew exactly 
                what I wanted to do: perform data science research in order to eliminate 
                racial disparities in the healthcare, education, and criminal justice systems.

                I have many ideas for combining my two passions, but currently I am 
                working on organizing coding workshops to teach introductory coding 
                to students in underserved and overlooked communities. I would like 
                to travel to different schools and make sure that every student at 
                least has the opportunity to try technology and explore careers 
                within the vast field of computer science. I just finished running 
                <a href="index.html#resources" onclick="resources()">my first workshop back at my own high school</a>, as they 
                don't have web development as a part of their curriculum, and seeing students' faces 
                light up at the websites they created inspires me to keep going.
